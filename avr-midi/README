avr-midi is a library written by Alex Norman with help from the Atmega16 manual
(usart) and http://www.borg.com/~jglatt/tech/midispec.htm

It is licenced with the GPL v3 licence, see the file "COPYING" for more info.

Please send me bug info, bug fixes, general improvements, etc.  alex@x37v.info

The important files are "midi.c" and "midi.h".  I have provided some examples
and Makefile to show you how to use avr-midi for the atmega16.  This should
work for other avr chips [maybe with some modification] as well, but has only
been tested on the atmega16.
